Introduction:

Web scraping is the process of collecting and parsing raw data from the Web and with Python we are able to do that.

In this repository you can find 3 different files:

- WebScraper: products parser from a simple e-commerce webpage.
- WebScraper_pagination: parser from a e-commerce webpage that has a products pagination.
